https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlPREQ55kzc
Made in Raylib with C.
Unsure at this moment how likely I will finish on time, as it's my first major project
in Raylib, and It's been a while since using c/c++.

### Current Game Idea
- Simple? Space flying sim, around a Topopolis megastructure around a star
- Not Aiming for a fun game with this idea, mainly looking for decent visuals with simple shaders.

### Other Game Ideas
- TBA
